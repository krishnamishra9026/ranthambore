                  <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RANTHAMBHORE NATIONAL PARK- A LAND OF TIGERS</strong></p>
                  <p>RANTHAMBORE NATIONAL PARK<span style="font-weight: 400;">is one of the renowned and well-known tiger lands. It is the only one and the biggest national park in the world with numerous types of species, flora, and fauna.&nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;The </span>RANTHAMBHORE National PARK<span style="font-weight: 400;"> got its name from the RANTHAMBHORE fort which is in the middle of the jungle. This fort witnessed the major history and changes of this park.&nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before independence, there was extensive forest cover on the Indian subcontinent. But with the increasing population and industrialization, the forest was badly exploited. And with the shrinking forest, the wildlife of the country also started shortening. This became a source of concern for the nation resulting in strict rules and policies for RANTHAMBHORE PARK.</span></p>
                  <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>MAHARAJAS HUNTING GROUND</strong></p>
                  <p>RANTHAMBHORE NATIONAL PARK <span style="font-weight: 400;">was previously privately owned by the MAHARAJAS of Jaipur. Until the year 1955, it was an exclusive and popular hunting ground of Jaipur's Royal family. And after that, it was declared &ldquo; Sawai Madhopur Sanctuary&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But due to constant fall in the numbers of tigers, in the year 1973, the sanctuary was declared under the project tiger to protect the tigers.&nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More strict policies and rules were formulated to make project Tiger a success. And then the major rule came in the year 1980 when 282.03 sq. Km of this sanctuary was declared national park. After this, the collection of forest produce by the government was reduced.&nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then in 1983, an adjacent north side of the land was named Kela Devi Sanctuary. Similarly, 130 sq km in 1984 was declared Sawai Mansingh Sanctuary.</span></p>
                  <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS</strong></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the government constant support for project Tiger and Tiger conservation reserve, an ace result was achieved. In the year 2014 census, the tiger count reached 60. Also, after that, this land became the most preferred land for experiencing wildlife animals and especially tigers in their natural habitat.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1970, tiger sightseeing in the park was extremely rare. Then in 1991, notoriety was attained as per which illegal poaching of the tiger was a punishable offense. And since then the number of tigers constantly increased until 2005 when the demand for tiger skin shot up from China and Tibet. The park was again in danger of poachers. but with the constant support of authority, the number of tigers didn't decrease. and a good number of tigers in the park were achieved.</span></p>
